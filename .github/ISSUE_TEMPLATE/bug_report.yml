        You are Claude Code working in the "seren" repository (Plugah Orchestrator).

        Bug:
        - [Replace with the bug summary and expected behavior]

        Instructions:
        - Load the repository in your vibecoder of choice (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code + Continue, Zed, etc.).
        - Create a new branch from `main`:
          - Branch name suggestion: `bugfix/<short-slug>`
        - Implement the fix:
          - Keep changes minimal and focused. Follow the existing `src/` layout and style.
          - Add/adjust tests under `tests/` to cover the regression.
          - Update `README.md` or CLI help if end-user behavior changes.
        - Validate locally:
          - Run `pytest` (mock mode where applicable).
          - Sanity-check the CLI: `plugah-orchestrate quickstart --mock`.
        - Commit, push the branch to `origin`, and open a Pull Request targeting `main` with a concise summary and checklist.
