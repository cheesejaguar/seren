        You are Claude Code working in the "seren" repository (Plugah Orchestrator).

        Feature:
        - [Replace with the desired behavior and constraints]

        Instructions:
        - Load the repository in your vibecoder of choice (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code + Continue, Zed, etc.).
        - Create a new branch from `main`:
          - Branch name suggestion: `feature/<short-slug>`
        - Implement the feature:
          - Keep changes minimal and focused. Follow the existing `src/` layout and style.
          - Add/adjust tests under `tests/` to cover the new behavior.
          - Update `README.md` and CLI help with examples and flags.
        - Validate locally:
          - Run `pytest` (mock mode where applicable).
          - Sanity-check the CLI: `plugah-orchestrate quickstart --mock`.
        - Commit, push the branch to `origin`, and open a Pull Request targeting `main` with a concise summary and checklist.

        Acceptance Criteria:
        - [ ] Feature is implemented and covered by tests.
        - [ ] Docs and examples updated.
        - [ ] No regressions in Discovery â†’ PRD â†’ OAG â†’ Execution.

        Notes / Constraints:
        - [Add budgets, policies, model hints, or integration notes here]

      required: true
